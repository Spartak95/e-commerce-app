#In the context of a Eureka server configuration, these two properties control how a client
#(or the Eureka server itself) interacts with the Eureka service registry. Here's what they mean:

#register-with-eureka: false:

#  This setting determines whether the application should register itself with the Eureka server as a client.
#  When set to false, the application (in this case, the Eureka server) does not register itself as a service.
#  Since this is the Eureka server configuration itself, it doesn’t need to register with Eureka, as it is the server
#  that other services will register to.

#fetch-registry: false:

#  This property controls whether the application should fetch the service registry from the Eureka server.
#  When set to false, the application will not retrieve the list of registered services from the Eureka server.
#  Since this configuration is for the Eureka server itself, it doesn’t need to fetch the registry of other services.
#  These settings are typical for a Eureka server because it is not intended to act as a client or register with
#  another Eureka server. It's responsible for managing service registrations and service discovery for other
#  client applications.
